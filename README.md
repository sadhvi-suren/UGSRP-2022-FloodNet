## Introduction
The Floodnet project is a cooperative of communities across NYC working towards collecting real time flooding data that could aid in understanding urban flooding caused by extreme precipitation, tidal events, and the combination of both. As under graduate researchers we focused on analysing data from FloodNet sensors and other community-based data sources like Floodwatch and 311 Complaints. Unlike these sources, which depend on communities to report flooding events, Floodnet uses ultrasonic sensors deployed in different parts of the city to detect flood depth.
